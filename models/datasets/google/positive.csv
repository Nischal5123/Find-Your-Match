objects to curves. meanwhile the unique new smart fill tool lets you apply a fill to any enclosed area by creating a new object from an enclosed area. unlike conventional fill tools that fill only objects the smart fill tool detects the edges of an area and creates a closed path so that the area can be filled. for example the smart fill tool can fill the loops of a freehand line that crosses over itself. the smart fill tool creates a path around the area so the filled object can be moved copied or edited. powerful accurate tracing coreldraw graphics suite x3 provides a more streamlined integrated tracing solution that delivers accurate and optimized bitmap-to-vector tracing results. integrated with coreldraw x3 the new corel powertrace allows users to quickly and easily convert

color mode including spot colors. you can also choose from several preset tracing styles color modes and background options. with three different preview modes -- before and after large preview and wireframe overlay -- corel powertrace makes it easy to analyze the result and adjust the settings used to trace your image. efficient photo editing coreldraw graphics suite x3 puts the focus on providing design professionals with more efficient intuitive and accurate photo editing. corel photo-paint x3 is now significantly faster when working with large images and applying photo effects resulting in better real-time feedback and improving overall workflow efficiency. improved object handling gives designers more precise control in rotating skewing or distorting objects. for large images improved use of image cache provides significantly increased response time for previewing most effects and for manipulating objects. the new integrated image adjustment lab saves designers valuable time and is accessible from both corel photo-paint and coreldraw. design professionals often work with files that have poor color balance and contrast and they need to use multiple tools to make adjustments. the image adjustment lab addresses this problem by uniting a number of manual and automatic controls for common color and tone corrections providing an intuitive and fast way to achieve professional image adjustments. the image adjustment lab also lets users create snapshots of their adjustments with just one click. the snapshots appear below the working preview which lets users easily compare each snapshot against the original and choose the best result. built on the power of corel knockout the enhanced cutout lab includes new controls to simplify the process of cutting out image areas and to improve accuracy. the new add detail and remove detail tools make it easy to refine the cutout area. for easy reference when defining the cutout area users can preview

cisco security server agent (windows and solaris) 100-agent bundle with the addition of cisco security agent endpoint security software cisco offers its customers the most comprehensive network security threat protection portfolio for securing large corporate networks. 64821.43,cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ) the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console. cisco systems - enterprise 0,1

jpegs. the tools -- including levels white balance exposure sharpening noise reduction and more -- afford you the freedom to experiment without having to worry about damaging your valuable original images. view larger. providing the very first all-in-one tool for your post-production needs aperture lets you work with raw images through every step of the digital workflow without first having to

all -- import edit catalog organize retouch publish and archive your photographs -- in a raw-focused workflow that's the first of its kind. rather than using another application to manage your images aperture offers built-in project management with robust and flexible tools that make it easy to handle thousands of projects. they include a powerful suite of tools for editing a photo shoot. it's one of the most tedious jobs any photographer faces and it's been particularly taxing when shooting raw. but aperture provides tools specifically designed to work with raw files and to speed you through the process of sifting through thousands of images culling the rejects comparing the keepers and identifying your absolutely finest photographs. nor do you have to convert your images in order to make needed adjustments. you can perfect them without having to leave aperture using a powerful suite of nondestructive image editing tools. the tools -- including levels white balance exposure sharpening noise reduction and more -- afford you the freedom to experiment without having to worry about damaging your valuable original images. that's because aperture applies modifications only to versions of your images and never to the original master images themselves. professional project management aperture the first all-in-one post-production tool for photographers provides everything you need to manage your photo library: flexible organizational tools comprehensive metadata support and powerful search tools that let you find files instantly. for easy organization and searching aperture comes with collections of associated keyword sets (and lets you create your own). aperture lets you import photos from a wide variety of sources and preserves the method you used to organize files when you drag folders from your hard drive and drop them into aperture. in fact because aperture supports both applescript and automator you can streamline many aspects of your workflow by automating those day-in day-out tasks you repeatedly find yourself doing. organize a photo library with thousands of projects any way you want -- in projects albums folders or any combination thereof. create multiple albums of related images within a project. or nest folders inside a project to organize albums books websites and light tables. you can even have aperture automatically group images together into smart albums based on defined criteria. with aperture you can work on multiple projects at once and freely copy or move photos among folders projects and albums. aperture lets you view extract and add metadata with unprecedented ease. on import it automatically extracts all industry-standard exif and iptc metadata. what's more it lets you comprehensively add important metadata -- copyright captions keywords -- at the point of import. as you work with images you're never more than a keystroke away from seeing your metadata in for example the customizable metadata heads-up display where you can customize the metadata to suit your needs. you can also choose what metadata aperture displays with your images and what metadata to embed when you export images. and when it comes to keywords aperture significantly outshines other applications. it not only supports true hierarchical keywording but also provides a number of intuitive ways to assign keywords to images. for example aperture comes with collections of associated keyword sets (and lets you create your own). call up the wedding set for example and you'll have a group of associated keywords -- bride table shots wedding party vows candids limo cake cutting -- any of which you can assign with a keystroke. using the keyword heads-up display you can drag and drop keywords onto a single image or entire group of images at once. and here's a real time-saver once you've assigned a variety of keywords to an image aperture lets you lift them from one image and stamp them onto other images. assigning and working with keywords has never been simpler or more rewarding. powerful compare and select tools open any of the heads-up displays (huds) available in aperture to adjust levels increase brightness modify color temperature

specifically to address the needs of the professional photographer. aperture lets you view multiple photos side by side offering a great way to evaluate similar images or multiple versions of the same image. view larger. if you've shot transparencies you're familiar with stacks. you've almost certainly created piles of similar images for fast comparison on your light table. in aperture you can employ the same technique with digital stacks. aperture lets you create stacks manually pulling images into stacks from any album project or folder in your library. or you can have aperture automatically create stacks for you based on the time interval between shutter clicks (1 second to 1 minute). this provides a quick and easy way to compile a sequence of bracketed or sequentially shot images for review. to further aid image comparison aperture lets you quickly rate your images using a six-level rating system (1 to 5 stars plus reject). when you're finished you can collapse the stack to eliminate clutter from your workspace. of course with that large high-resolution screen right before your eyes wouldn't it be great if you could take advantage of all that real estate and review your images full screen? with aperture you can. in fact aperture lets you view your images full screen as large as screen real estate permits. and if you have two displays you can take advantage of aperture's expansive full-screen mode on both of them to create an incomparable working environment. using the filmstrip displayed along the bottom or side of your monitor you can see thumbnails of all the images you're reviewing. you can navigate through them quickly and easily to find the images you want to see even organizing them on the fly. open any of the heads-up displays

identifies your original images as digital masters and it has built-in safeguards to ensure that you can't accidentally overwrite or modify them. in fact it's physically impossible to alter a single pixel of a digital master. instead. aperture takes a novel and completely nondestructive approach to image editing. thanks to aperture's no-regrets retouching policy you can experiment freely without fear or concern creating as many versions as you'd like with different exposure settings image croppings color temperature modifications level adjustments or any combination thereof. thanks to aperture's no-regrets retouching policy you can experiment freely without fear or concern creating as many versions as you'd like with different exposure settings image croppings color temperature modifications level adjustments or any combination thereof until you achieve the exact results you're after. and you don't have to worry about making a mistake. you can modify or delete any adjustment at any time and with no consequences. unlike the duplicate files you need to create in other applications image versions take up virtually no storage space so you don't pay an overhead penalty. and aperture automatically keeps track of all your image versions for you sequentially numbering them on the fly and connecting them to the master image as part of a stack. offering native raw image editing and breakthrough speed aperture puts the most essential adjustment tools at your immediate disposal via either the adjustments inspector or the adjustments heads-up display (hud). using these tools you can fine-tune exposure use a histogram to check and adjust levels set white balance or modify highlight and shadows. if you need to crop straighten horizons reduce noise correct red-eye or eliminate dust you'll find intuitive tools available to you. in fact if you use any of the adjustment tools to modify or retouch an image you can use aperture's unique lift and stamp tool to apply those modifications to any number of additional images. versatile printing and publishing using aperture you can produce high-quality prints and contact sheets design customized books and create impressive websites as beautiful as the photographs you take. best of all you can do it all with drag-and-drop ease. produce high-quality prints and contact sheets design customized books and create

again: softproofing onscreen in the live preview area of the application's robust and resizable print dialog. if the image you see isn't perfect fine-tune your output by making gamma adjustments or by turning on black-point compensation. if you've ever tried to print contact sheets using other photo applications you're probably familiar with the expression there's gotta be a better way. now there is. aperture lets you print contact sheets more quickly and easily than you can using just about any other photo application available today. there's more good aperture printing news. in addition to helping you create your own color-correct prints aperture also provides an integrated print-ordering service that lets you order silver-halide prints directly from kodak and fuji at highly competitive pricing. color managed for consistency the prints assure predictable results and are available in standard sizes and large formats. you can also depend on aperture's built-in color management if you use a service bureau to print your photos. aperture's export preset editor lets you simply select the icc profile recommended by or obtained from your service bureau from a drop-down menu. aperture embeds the profile in your files upon export so you'll know what to expect when you get the photos in the mail. beautiful color-accurate prints. presenting prospective clients with a handsome bound and printed stock book sends a powerful message. and aperture makes the production of such high-quality bound books both simple and affordable. to help you put a unique stamp on them aperture includes a sophisticated book-layout engine that offers significant design flexibility. need to publish your photos to the web fast? aperture's wysiwyg web publishing tools make it easy. view larger. want your website to be as beautiful as your photos? aperture makes it drag-and-drop easy. no need to learn html or to use cumbersome wizard-based page generators. aperture includes professionally designed gallery and journal templates to get you started. with the former you can create pages of thumbnail galleries; with the latter narrative-style web pages that mix photos with text and can include your own photos as custom headers. unlike other photo applications aperture templates aren't set in stone. using the web gallery template for example you can decide how many rows and columns of images appear on each page how large the thumbnails should be and what metadata should accompany the images. what's more -- and this is important -- aperture's web-authoring environment is wysiwyg. any change you make happens on screen in real time so you can see the effect right away. this offers a significant advantage over the many wizard-based applications that force you to step through one dialog after another. cumbersome to use they don't let you see the results of your changes until the very end. aperture offers a welcome change letting you see your site develop right before your eyes. apple 299,1

world of warcraft burning crusade 39.99,world of warcraft expansion: burning crusade blizzard entertainment took online role playing by storm with their hit title world of warcraft. with mind-boggling improvements in graphics gameplay networking and interface -- really every category -- this game became the crown prince of the genre. world of warcraft players will be excited by the approaching release of the new expansion pack: world of warcraft: the burning crusade. this pack expands the already massive award-winning multiplayer online role-playing game by tremendous bounds adding new races lands battlegrounds professions and items and much much more. although no release date has been set here is sample of what you can expect from the burning crusade. the burning crusade is the highly anticipated unreleased expansion pack for blizzard's world of warcraft. what lies in medivh's tower? view larger. blood elves emerge as a new race in the burning crusade. view larger. the blood elves seek the golden destiny that has been promised to them. view larger. warcraft's newest continent: outland. view larger. once a beautiful land outland has been ravaged by war. view larger. outland is a vital strategic location. view larger. the expansion pack features an increase in the level cap to 70. there are two new playable races including the magical blood elves that you can read more about below. the other race has not yet been released by blizzard. there will be new starting zones in quel'thalas and beyond. another eye-opening addition is the entirely new unexplored continent of outland that is reachable through the dark portal. plus you'll find many new high-level dungeons to explore in azeroth outland and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. there are new flying mounts in outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: jewelcrafting. of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack. the new story the rumors and more several years have passed since the burning legion's defeat at mount hyjal and the races of azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. with renewed strength the heroes of the horde and alliance have begun to explore new lands and have broken through the dark portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. in this expansion pack the burning crusade refers to the burning legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life on azeroth. to date the burning legion's exploits have been documented in warcraft iii and in the war of the ancients novel trilogy. as part of the expansion pack players will now be able to travel through the dark portal to confront the legion on otherworldly battlefields. although only one race has been revealed blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. on the other hand many details have been released about the new continent outland. players last visited outland in warcraft iii: the frozen throne alongside illidan as he conquered the pit lord magtheridon's domain. players will also gain access to quel'thalas the region to the northeast of the forsaken lands where the blood elves reside. blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead. blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion though the exact number has not yet been determined. one upcoming dungeon that has players excited is karazhan which is located within medivh's tower. because medivh has played such a central role in warcraft lore blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what karazhan contains. as for battlegrounds blizzard has released very little information. however they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the caverns of time. blood elves: the new race thousands of years ago the exiled highborne landed on the shores of lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of quel'thas. these high elves as they called themselves created a fountain of vast magical energies within the heart of their land -- the sunwell. over time they grew dependant on the sunwell's unstable energies regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past. during the third war the villainous prince arthas invaded quel'thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. his undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. in addition he used the sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead lich kel'thuzad thereby fouling the sunwell's mystical waters. the few elven survivors realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power grew increasingly volatile and desperate. in the midst of the elves' darkest hour came kael'thas sunstrider the last of quel'thalas' royal bloodline. kael as he was commonly known knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. renaming his people blood elves in honor of their fallen countrymen kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. in search of a new destiny for his people kael'thas ventured to the remote world of outland where he encountered the fallen night elf illidan. under illidan's watchful eye kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power. unfortunately the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the alliance to shun them. thus the remaining blood elves on azeroth look desperately to the horde to help them reach outland where they can reunite with kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them. outland: the new continent once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs all that remains of draenor is the scattered wastes of outland. following the second war the alliance invaded draenor by crossing through the dark portal. to their horror they discovered that ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten horde to newer unspoiled worlds. as the alliance forces closed in around him ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. however his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of draenor to pieces. nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the third war -- the fallen night elf illidan discovered that huge chunks of draenor still existed floating upon the astral winds of the twisting nether. after his defeat at the hands of the evil prince arthas illidan fled to the remnants of draenor and dubbed them outland. he quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of ner'zhul's gateways. though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably arthas the new lich king and the remaining lords of the burning legion. for now outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes primitive orcs and powerful arcane creatures of the nether itself. agents of the burning legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending burning crusade to scour all life from the universe. what else can expected? blizzard has tantalized warcraft players with the brief glimpse into the burning crusade's storyline. will these heroes find friends or foes? what dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the dark portal? and what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible burning crusade? these and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing warcrafters. blizzard entertainment 39.99,1

groups apart or convert objects to curves. meanwhile the unique new smart fill tool lets you apply a fill to any enclosed area by creating a new object from an enclosed area. unlike conventional fill tools that fill only objects the smart fill tool detects the edges of an area and creates a closed path so that the area can be filled. for example the smart fill tool can fill the loops of a freehand line that crosses over itself. the smart fill tool creates a path around the area so the filled object can be moved copied or edited. powerful accurate tracing coreldraw graphics suite x3 provides a

after large preview and wireframe overlay -- corel powertrace makes it easy to analyze the result and adjust the settings used to trace your image. efficient photo editing coreldraw graphics suite x3 puts the focus on providing design professionals with more efficient intuitive and accurate photo editing. corel photo-paint x3 is now significantly faster when working with large images and applying photo effects resulting in better real-time feedback and improving overall workflow efficiency. improved object handling gives designers more precise control in rotating skewing or distorting objects. for large images improved use of image cache provides significantly increased response time for previewing most effects and for manipulating objects. the new integrated image adjustment lab saves designers valuable time and is accessible from both corel photo-paint and coreldraw. design professionals often work with files that have poor color balance and contrast and they need to use multiple tools to make adjustments. the image adjustment lab addresses this problem by uniting a number of manual and automatic controls for common color and tone corrections providing an intuitive and fast way to achieve professional image adjustments. the image adjustment lab also lets users create snapshots of their adjustments with just one click. the snapshots appear below the working preview which lets users easily compare each snapshot against the original and choose the best result. built on the power of corel knockout the enhanced cutout lab includes new controls to simplify the process of cutting out image areas and to improve accuracy. the new add detail and remove detail tools make it easy to refine the cutout area. for easy reference when defining the cutout area users can preview
